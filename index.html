                                spending time with friends, playing music (I play piano, guitar, and cello, among others), gaming, coding, and teaching myself new skills (most recently lock-picking and pickle-making). I have a

                                <p>My main project at AGX was developing a mobile messaging application using React Native. Within the first few weeks of joining the team, I was able to improve the time it took messages to send from over 5 seconds to less than 1 second. 
                                   Because of this and other improvements that I made, I became the team leader for the project within the first two months of joining AdventGX. This project was built using React Native and AWS - specifically, DynamoDB and AWS Lambda.
                                <br><br>   
                                    In addition to this project, I worked on a web application that helps to visualize geographic data, which would be used to research the diffusion of technology in affinity networks, and developed web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                                    to assist the businesses in AdventGX's startup incubator.
                                <br><br>
                                   Collectively, I gained experience in developing with React Native, DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, Python, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as in leading a software development team and working with an assortment of APIs and libraries.</p>

                                <p>My first task as an undergraduate researcher was formatting documents using LaTeX in Overleaf. 
                                   Once that was completed, I developed a web application using React, SQLite, MariaDB and other technologies to aid in the research process. The application did so by allowing research participants to complete IRB forms digitally,
                                   then it stored these completed forms for the researchers to use later.</p>

                                 visits the boys at Still Creek Ranch to serve as mentors and support their development in any way possible. In addition, because Still Creek Ranch is a non-profit organization
                                 that operates solely off of donations, we organize and facilitate an annual 5k mud run called Gladiator Dash to raise money for them. Though we primarily focus on serving Still
                                 Creek Ranch, we serve the community in countless other ways, like volunteering at Twin City Missions, visiting the children at Miracle Farm, participating in Big Event, and supporting
                                 other organization's philanthropic endeavors.</p>

                                Because of this, I make additional trips to Still Creek each week to get one-on-one time with my mentee.</p>
