                        <div class="content">
                            <p>I am a software developer with 3+ years of professional experience in the industry. I graduated from Texas A&M University in May 2020 with a B.S. in computer science and a minor in cybersecurity. 
                                <br><br>
                                I also have a mild-obsession with learning new things. My most notable recent interests include: DJ'ing (yes, turntable and all), learning the accordion and saxophone, getting <b>very</b> good at chess, espresso, learning Spanish, running, and knitting. 
                                Beyond that, I enjoy spending time with friends, playing music (piano, guitar, and bass, among others), gaming, and, of course, coding. I have a
                                passion for learning, programming, and forming relationships with people! </p>

                                <h3 class="title">Software Developer - <span class="place"><a href="https://www.producepro.com/">Produce Pro Software</a></span> <span class="year">(October 2020 - Present)</span></h3>
                                <p>Produce Pro Software is ERP system tailored towards perishable goods. It uses a proprietary programming language, so starting out I was tasked with learning a new language, how inventory systems work, how a warehouse <i>should</i> work, and learning the quirks of the produce industry as a whole.
                                    This was an intimidating task even for me, but within the first three months I succeeding in upgrading a customer's code on-site, and provided them with consultation throughout the process.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The produce industry is pretty old-fashioned (with some of them even still using fax machines daily), so building a rapport with customers is crucial to the success of the company. I speak with customers daily, guiding them through the designs of new changes
                                    they'd like to implement, or working with them to test and debug issues in the system. My main responsibility is still designing, implementing, and maintaining the code, but it involves vastly more consulting work than the average software developer job.
                                <br><br>   
                                    In my time at Produce Pro, I have added countless new features to the system, as well as identified, tested, and resolved hundreds of bugs. I have demonstrated my ability at connecting with the customer
                                    and leading them through trips, so I now act as the site-lead on consultation trips. I was also selected to be one of only a few points of contact for Del Monte, our largest customer.
                                <br><br>
                                   Through my experiences at Produce Pro, I have learned an immense amount about building relationships with customers, fullstack development and seeing a change through the entire development cycle, as well as working in a large but flexible company.</p>

                                <p>My main project at AGX was developing a mobile messaging application using React Native. Within the first few weeks of joining the team, I was able to improve the time it took messages to send from over 5 seconds to less than 1 second. 
                                   Because of this and other improvements that I made, I became the team leader for the project within the first two months of joining AdventGX. This project was built using React Native and AWS - specifically, DynamoDB and AWS Lambda.
                                <br><br>   
                                    In addition to this project, I worked on a web application that helps to visualize geographic data, which would be used to research the diffusion of technology in affinity networks, and developed web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                                    to assist the businesses in AdventGX's startup incubator.
                                <br><br>
                                   Collectively, I gained experience in developing with React Native, DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, Python, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as in leading a software development team and working with an assortment of APIs and libraries.</p>

                                <p>My first task as an undergraduate researcher was formatting documents using LaTeX in Overleaf. 
                                   Once that was completed, I developed a web application using React, SQLite, MariaDB and other technologies to aid in the research process. The application did this by allowing research participants to complete IRB forms digitally,
                                   then storing these completed forms for the researchers to use later.</p>

                                    <p> One of my somewhat recent hobbies is mixology. As anyone without a "go-to" cocktail knows, choosing a drink can sometimes be a bit of ordeal - even more so without a real menu to look at.
                                        My solution to this problem was to build a web application that would have all of my on-hand ingredients stored and provide a list of available cocktails to my guests. When they choose a drink
                                        and order it, it provides me with a notification of who ordered what, along with the recipe of the drink they ordered. This saves time in the guest choosing a drink to enjoy, and encourages me 
                                        to try out drinks I've never made!
                                     <br><br> 
                                        I am using a cloud-hosted NoSQL database to store requests, recipes, etc. and am building the web application simply with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for now.
                                        Once I get more core functionality I will probably add some more flair. This is still a work in progress, but stay tuned for updates!

                                Extremely experienced in object-oriented programming, through coursework and personal projects. Additonally, I have experience with countless other languages
                                and technologies such as Python, React, React Native, C++ and Java. I am a fast learner, so I excel at new languages quickly.
                                I also have a strong understanding of data structures, algorithms, and mathematics. The following languages and technologies is not an exhaustive list, just a few worth highlighting. </p>
